## 3. Features

### 3.1 Navigation

The navigation bar is designed with user story 2 in mind. Given the relatively simple nature and purpose of the site, it is a single page site that a user can scroll through to view all the available information and features. However, links to the top of each key section are also provided in the navigation bar to further aid easy navigation. Links are therefore provided to HOME, TESTIMONIALS, GALLERY and CONTACT US. The navigation bar is sticky so that the navigation links are always available to the user. The navigation bar also contains the business logo. This also provides a link to the top or home position as this is likely to be expected by a typical user from a UX point of view.

### 3.2 Header

The header contains an hero image to convey an initial impression of the possible subject of the website in that it shows a house and garden. The business name "Mark's Maintenance Killarney" features prominently together with the sub-heading "Your Local One-stop Garden and Property Maintenance Service". Combined these work to convey the purpose of the site and so address user story 1 above. The header also contains a seperate tag line of "As Life's Too Short for DIY!" This is aimed at gently encouraging potential customers to use the services provided as well as conveying a sense that this business caters for smaller jobs, not just biger ones.

### 3.3 What we do

This section outlines the competencies of the business in a clear simple format. Background colours for each of the sections are different and are chosen in keeping with the particular area of competence, for example a light green shade for the gardening section. The key specific services are outlined in the form of a short paragraph in a conversational style. This is aimed at making the business appear more accessible on a personal level for the potential customer. The business is on the customer's side and understands the pain of taking on DIY. No problem. This business will do it for you. This feature addresses user story 3 above.

### 3.4 Testimonials

Testimonials are provided to address user story 4 above. Each testimonial relates to one of the 4 main areas of competence and there are four testimonials one for each of these areas. There are two testimonials from women and two from men.

### 3.5 Gallery

A photographic gallery has been provided to address user story 5 above. The gallery provides examples of work in each of the four main areas of competence.

### 3.6 Contact Us

The Contact Us section aims to address user story 6. Given the nature of the service it is quite likely that potential customers will contact this business by phone. Therefore the contact number is clearly displayed. An email address is also provided. Some customers may prefer to complete a form to send queries, particularly initial queries and therefore a simple form to address this need is also provided.

### 3.7 Footer

A simple footer is also included to complete the page asthetic. It also repeats the contact information as this is a likely UX expectation. Links to social media are also included. The business has an existing facebook page for posting occasional updates and uses instagram to post photos of recently completed work. However the business considers these to currently be a simple form of online advertising but not a primary contact stream and therefore the social media links are not included in the Contact Us section.

## 4. future features

Two potential future features have been identified at this point as follows:

1. Provision of a Business to Business (B2B) section is a likely short term add on goal. It would be reasonably straight forward to add this on as the service offering would be the same. The B2B section would focus more on additional information that business might require such as VAT registration, VAT number, Tax Clearance Status, Insurances etc. It could also provide addition specification detail regarding certain services. For example a larger business may require more detail on the type of equipment the business holds. For cutting lawns does the business have a ride-on with a large cutting capacity or a smaller capacity walk behind mower? This could be important to a property management company for example. Also a B2B section could suggest possible business link ups. For example, "Are you a furniture store? Maybe you want to consider offering an assembly service directly to your customers? Talk to us!" While the addition of the B2B section is not technically difficult it does requie the provision of more detailed information all of which would need to be carefully reviewed for accuracy. Given the time that would be required it was considered more beneficial to the business' goal to launch the site without this initially and add it later.

2. A longer term goal might be the provision of pricing information. However given the relatively wide range of services provided this is a more difficult proposition. Factors such as equipment required for a given job, required total labour hours, distance to the job site etc. all form part of the calculation. Any future provision of such information would have to be very carefully considered by the business owners.
