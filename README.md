## 4. Future Features

Two potential future features have been identified at this point as follows:

1. Provision of a Business to Business (B2B) section is a likely short term add on goal. It would be reasonably straight forward to add this on as the service offering would be the same. The B2B section would focus more on additional information that business might require such as VAT registration, VAT number, Tax Clearance Status, Insurances etc. It could also provide addition specification detail regarding certain services. For example a larger business may require more detail on the type of equipment the business holds. For cutting lawns does the business have a ride-on with a large cutting capacity or a smaller capacity walk behind mower? This could be important to a property management company for example. Also a B2B section could suggest possible business link ups. For example, "Are you a furniture store? Maybe you want to consider offering an assembly service directly to your customers? Talk to us!" While the addition of the B2B section is not technically difficult it does requie the provision of more detailed information all of which would need to be carefully reviewed for accuracy. Given the time that would be required it was considered more beneficial to the business' goal to launch the site without this initially and add it later.

2. A longer term goal might be the provision of pricing information. However given the relatively wide range of services provided this is a more difficult proposition. Factors such as equipment required for a given job, required total labour hours, distance to the job site etc. all form part of the calculation. Any future provision of such information would have to be very carefully considered by the business owners.

## 5. Typography and Color Scheme

### 5.1 Typography

* The chosen font for Headings is Montserrat.

* The chosen font for all other text is Hind.

* It is considered that together they convey the simple, clean, businesslike approach required for this website.

* The pairings were chosen from Google Fonts with reference to www.fontpair.co

### 5.2 Color Scheme

* The font-color is #131817 which is close to black and was chosen to ensure the text is easily read on lighter backgrounds.

* All other colors have been chosen to ensure clear contrast with the font-color.

* All other colors have been chosen to be in keeping with the overall theme of the site that being it is related to gardens, property, handyperson work or if the color is deemed to relate to a specific competency of the business.

* The background colour is #f7f2c7. It does not distract from the site content and aligns with the hero image.

* The background color for the header and footer is #cac59d and was chosen to provide a degree of contrast from the main body of the page without being radically different. The subtle difference is important particularly for the header which is fixed and would otherwise blend into the background at certain scroll locations.

* The background color for the link hover position is #8fbc8f and the font color is white (#ffffff). These were chosen to provide adequate contrast with each other and the pre-hover position.

* The background color for text on the hero image is #deb887. This was chosen to provide adequate contrast with the image but remains in keeping with the main background color.

* The background color for the garden section is #abc977. This is a green color in keeping with the gardening theme.

* The background color for the flat-pack assembly section is #a6c4c4, a light grey, thought to reflect a more functional, mechanical competence.

* The background color for the pressure washing and cleaning section is #94f7f7, a light blue color thought to reflect water and therefore appropriate to this section.

* The background color for the interior painting and decorating section is #f5c9c9, a warmer, calm color refecting the comfort gained from an interiors upgrade.

* The background color for the contact form is #d48888. This was chosen to provide adequate contrast and clearly define the form. It is similar to but darker than the interiors color and so stands out without being completely alien to the page.

* The hover color for the form imputs is white. This is considered to clearly indicate an input field to the user.

   ### 8.3 Fixed Bugs

1. At certain screen widths the navigation elements were not well aligned.

Solution: Reviewed, adjusted and added media queries to better control font-size, float and letter spacing at various screen widths. Also removed the font awesome icon from the logo at screen widths less than 340px to free up screen space. This was achieved by adding a span element to contain the icon in the index.html file and then targeting this span in an @media screen and (max-width: 340px) media query with a css rule display: none.

2. When deployed to Github the main heading sat too high on screens less than 700px and was partly covered by the header.

Solution: The simple solution was to adjust the absolute position of the main heading div element to top: 30px. This solved the issue for the relevant screen width range with other media queries already successfully governing positioning above and below this.
